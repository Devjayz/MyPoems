  <h3 class="w3-center">10 FEELINGS, 1 REASON</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>JANELLE IGLESIAS</em></p>

<p> <p class="w3-center"> I was shy, shy, because you were different. I didn't know how to react to your kind, sweet, and gentle ways that tease the strings of my heart without showing a hint of pleasure towards you. How you smiled the way I pictured the angels would never make it easy for me to not kneel before you and ask to marry me. How your eyes become a gate to paradise only seeing myself and you together. I was shy because I never knew if you would like it if I made you feel the same way I felt. </p>

<p class="w3-center">  was mesmerized, mesmerized of the spell your soft voice takes control of me. How I'd wake up in the morning just to see the sun shine less brighter then you. </p>

<p class="w3-center"> Then I became afraid, afraid of how you affect me, afraid of hiding the feeling away will affect me. It frightened me to think that what if this is just temporary. I don't and never will want it to be temporary. </p>

<p class="w3-center"> Then I became afraid, afraid of how you affect me, afraid of hiding the feeling away will affect me. It frightened me to think that what if this is just temporary. I don't and never will want it to be temporary. </p>

<p class="w3-center"> I felt happy, happy that I was shown a possibility for my dreams and fantasies to come true. It made me smile every second of the day hearing all of what I feel but said with your voice and felt by you and not just me. I overflowed with joy because I knew that this is the start. The start of everything.</p>

<p class="w3-center"> I became so excited, excited to make you happy. Excited to greet you good morning when you wake up and good night before you sleep without being shy. Excited to buy you flowers and chocolates on Valentine's day without you thinking that it's weird. Excited to hold you in my arms at night. Excited to kiss you good bye every time I bring you home. Excited to walk in the hall way of the school holding your hand and make everyone know, know that no one can come between us. And let them know that I am yours, And you are mine. I was excited to love you. </p>

<p class="w3-center"> Love, love was the first word that came to my mind every time I saw you. You were more than just someone to admire. You became the missing piece to every incomplete puzzle in my life. You became my reason to start the day. The reason to reach I never thought to work hard for. You became a part of me. You became my other half.</p>

<p class="w3-center"> Then I started becoming conscious, conscious of how things went. It made me think of a hundred reasons to answer why do you not smile anymore every time I see you. When you laugh and I'm not the reason. When you barely say "Hi" when we meet by the hall way. When you hangout with others instead of me. What have I done wrong? What could possibly be the reason you don't want me to check your phone. Why I can't look at your messages. And you can't tell me where you've been really going. Then it all made sense that night. It made me feel one thing... </p>

<p class="w3-center"> Broken, You were everything to me and I did everything I can for you. And you pushed it aside for someone else. It shattered me to pieces. It brought me back to start. </p>

<p class="w3-center"> It drove me crazy, crazy to think that it crossed your mind. and It drove me more crazy to think day and night that maybe you liked it. Liked how he held you. how he would kiss you but he never thought if it was perfect or not. How he would tell you all the sweet words that I never stoop telling you. It drove me so crazy to ask the same question on and on again to myself. Is he better? better than how I love you? But it's okay, it really didn't stop my heart doing it's job even when my mind is telling me to stab it 4 times. I would die if I spat out the words "I don't want to love you anymore" It never stopped me from telling you  how much I love you even when the first thing that comes to my mind is the time you broke my heart. But my hearts continued to fight. It never gave up. It made me stronger and weak at the same time. I love you and it never changed. I forgive you and let things go back to normal.</p>

<p class="w3-center"> But forgiving doesn't make you forget. It will never be forgotten. It is unforgettable. </p>
